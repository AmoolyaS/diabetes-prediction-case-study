Problem Statement:
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease with significant implications for individual health and well-being. Early detection and intervention can help mitigate the risk and impact of diabetes. This project aims to develop an effective classification model to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes over the next 5 years based on various health parameters.

Data Preparation:
The dataset comprises information on 678 individuals, including features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure,
Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers. 
Feature selection was performed to retain relevant features for the predictive model.

Model Development:

Five classification algorithms were employed for model development:
1.	Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable linear model suitable for binary classification tasks.
2.	K-Nearest Neighbors: A non-parametric method effective for capturing complex patterns in the data.
3.	Support Vector Machine: Capable of capturing both linear and non-linear patterns using various kernel functions.
4.	Random Forest: A robust ensemble method known for its prediction accuracy and overfitting control.
5.	XGBoost: A scalable and efficient algorithm popular for its performance and speed.
The models were trained on the pre-processed dataset, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize their performance.
